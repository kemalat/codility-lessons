### Java char range
 It is used to declare the character-type variables and methods. It is capable of holding the unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters.The range of a variable of type char is from 0 to 2^16-1 or 0 to 65535.
 
### Sorting algorithm used Java's Collections.sort(List<E>) method
Java 8's Collections.sort(List<E>) uses `Iterative merge sort` algorithm, it requires fewer than n log(n) comparisons when the input array is partially sorted (adaptive) and this algorithm is guaranteed to be stable in nature.

### Single quotes vs Double quotes
Single quotes for literal chars, double quotes for literal Strings

`System.out.println('j'+'a'+'v'+'a');`

This statement prints total decimal value after summing of each asci character decimal value. (e.g.  106+97+118+97)

###  Anonymous inner class
It can extend exactly one class or implement exactly one interface.

### equals() vs hashCode() 
equals() and hashCode() are different methods and hashCode method should not be used to check if two object references are same. hashCode just returns int value for an object, even two different objects can have same hashCode integer. The value returned by hashCode() is the object's hash code, which is the object's memory address in hexadecimal. equals() checks if the two object references are same. If two objects are equal then their hashCode must be the same, but the reverse is not true.

### sleep() vs wait() 
sleep() is a method which is used to pause the process for few seconds or the time we want to. But in case of wait() method, thread goes in waiting state and it won’t come back automatically until we call the notify() or notifyAll(). 

- wait() is called an object; current thread must synchronize on the lock object.
- sleep() is called on currently executing thread.
- wait() – until call notify(), `notifyAll()` from object
- sleep() – until at least time expire or call `interrupt()`.

### fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators
- Fail-fast iterators operate directly on the collection itself. During iteration, fail-fast iterators fail as soon as they realize that the collection has been modified they will throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`. Some examples include `ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap`

- Fail-safe iterates operate on a cloned copy of the collection and therefore do not throw an exception if the collection is modified during iteration. Examples would include iterators returned by `ConcurrentHashMap or CopyOnWriteArrayList`

### ArrayList vs LinkedList vs Vector
- `ArrayList` and `Vector` are implemented as a resizable array. Vector is similar with ArrayList, but it is synchronized. When an element is inserted into (or removed from) the middle of the list, the elements that follow must all be shifted accordingly.If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, would be better to use ArrayList rather than Vector.

- `LinkedList` is implemented using a doubly linked list. Inserting or removing an element only requires updating the links that immediately precede and follow the element being inserted or removed. Linked is preferred when add and remove operations are more frequent than get operations
 
 ### ArrayDeque vs LinkedList
ArrayDeque is more efficient than the LinkedList for add and remove operation at both ends and LinkedList implementation is efficient for removing the current element during the iteration. The LinkedList implementation consumes more memory than the ArrayDeque.

### HashMap vs Hashtable
Both Hashtable and HashMap are data-structure based upon hashing and implementation of Map interface, the main difference between them is that HashMap is not thread-safe but Hashtable is thread-safe.HashMap allows null values with one null key but as key and value whereas Hashtable doesn't allow nulls

### LinkedHashMap vs HashMap
Main difference between HashMap and LinkedHashMap is that LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order of keys, order in which keys are inserted in to LinkedHashMap. On the other hand HashMap doesn't maintain any order or keys or values.

### Comparable vs Comparator 
Comparator interface sort collection using two objects provided to it(`compare(Object o1, Object O2)`), whereas comparable interface compares" this" refers to the one objects provided to it(`compareTo(Object a )`). If sorting of objects needs to be based on natural order then use Comparable whereas if you sorting needs to be done on attributes of different objects, then use Comparator in Java.

### Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions
Java forces you to handle Checked Exceptions, once you start compiling your program. If you dont catch FileNotFoundException, you will get compile time error with message – Unhandled exception type FileNotFoundException. 

Java also provides UncheckedExceptions, the occurrences of which are not checked by the compiler. They will come into life/occur into your program, once any buggy code is executed.Unchecked Exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException. Example of unchecked exceptions are : NullPointerException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, IllegalArgumentException,NumberFormatException

### Threadlocal
ThreadLocal instance can store different values for each thread independently. Each thread that accesses the get() or set() method of a ThreadLocal instance is accessing its own, independently initialized copy of the variable. Sample use case could be generating unique identifiers locally to each thread. A thread’s id might be assigned the first time when Thread invokes ThreadId.get() and remains unchanged on subsequent calls. Another use case is when you have some object that is not thread-safe, but you want to avoid synchronizing access to that object. Instead, give each thread its own instance of the object.

### How to make a variable shared in a synchronised block in Java?
Static variables might be shared between synchronised blocks. Static means shared across all the instances of that Class in a JVM. Shared resources are not thread-safe.Hence Static variables are not thread safe.So, if multiple threads tries to access a static variable, it may result in inconsistency.

### Collections Vs Streams
Collections are mainly used to store and group the data.Ex : List, Set, Map  
Streams are mainly used to perform operations on data.	Ex : filtering, mapping, matching  
You can add or remove elements from collections.  
You can’t add. modify or remove elements from streams.Stream consumes a source, performs operations on it and returns a result
Collections have to be iterated externally.  
Streams are internally iterated.  
Collections can be traversed multiple times.  
Streams are traversable only once.  
Collections are eagerly constructed.  
Streams are lazily constructed.  

### Immutable Object
Class fields are defined as final immutable data type. The value of the class field can only be set when the object is instantiated, and by having only a getter (getValue) the object's state cannot be changed after instantiation. 

### Static Class
Java does not allow making a top-level class static as option 
- Declaring class as final as it prevents extension of it
- Making the constructor private as it prevents instantiation
- Making all the members and functions of the class static. Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed.

### Lambda expression and use cases
- Java 8 provide support for lambda expressions only with functional interfaces. 
- Any Interface with single abstract method is called Functional Interface.
- Easy distribution of processing of collection over multiple threads.
- With the introduction of Stream API, functions can be passed to collection methods and now it is the responsibility of collection to process the elements either in a sequential or parallel manner.

### Static Vs. Dynamic Binding in Java
Static binding uses Type(Class in Java) information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Object to resolve binding
Dynamic Binding example : 


```java
public class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("animal is eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.eat(); // prints >> dog is eating...
    }

    @Override
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("dog is eating...");
    }
}
```
Static Binding example : 

```java
class Animal {
    static void eat() {
        System.out.println("animal is eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.eat(); // prints >> animal is eating...

    }

    static void eat() {
        System.out.println("dog is eating...");
    }
}
```

### Start N threads at “exactly” the same time

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;


public class ThreadExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(latch);
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread(latch);
        new Thread(t1).start();
        new Thread(t2).start();
        //Do whatever you want
        latch.countDown();          //This will inform all the threads to start
        //Continue to do whatever
    }
}

class MyThread implements Runnable
{
    CountDownLatch latch;
    public MyThread(CountDownLatch latch) 
    {
        this.latch = latch;
    }
    @Override
    public void run() 
    {
        try 
        {
            latch.await();          //The thread keeps waiting till it is informed
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        //Do the actual thing
    }
}
```
### 3-tier web application performance bottleneck analysis
- Network issues : Eliminate first that network connectivity and network devices are healthy( network interface card, firewall, cables, load balancer, routers etc)
- Test setup : Create near production setup, develop traffic generator and simulators, start performance tests
- Database Problems : Check On persistence configuration (lazy vs. eager loading), caching, and database connection pool configuration.
- Memory Problems: Check garbage collection configuration and memory leaks.
- Concurrency Problems: Check thread deadlocks, thread gridlocks, and thread pool configuration issues.

### What is Bean ? 
The objects that form the backbone of Spring application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. Inversion of Control is a process in which an object defines its dependencies without creating them. This object delegates the job of constructing such dependencies to an IoC container.

### Inversion of Control vs Dependency Injection
IoC (Inversion of Control) :- It’s a generic term and implemented in several ways (events, delegates etc).(IoC) means that objects do not create other objects on which they rely to do their work. Instead, they get the objects that they need from an outside source (for example, an xml configuration file).

DI (Dependency Injection) :- DI is a sub-type of IoC and is implemented by constructor injection, setter injection or Interface injection.
